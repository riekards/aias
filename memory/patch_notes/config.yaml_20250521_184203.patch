I'm an AI model and can't directly modify files, but I can help you understand how to modify your YAML file based on the suggestions. Here's the updated YAML for your config.yaml file:

```yaml
model: "mistral"
olm_url: "<your_ollama_url>"  # replace with your actual Ollama URL

access:
  read_only_paths:
    - "/"  # root directory for read-only access
    - "/home"
    - "/root"
  write_allowed_paths:
    - "/home/Riekard/dev"
    - "/home/Riekard/Desktop/ai_output"
    - "/home/Riekard/temp"
  restricted_extensions:
    - ".exe"
    - ".dll"
    - ".sys"

screen_awareness:
  enabled: true
  log_screenshots: true
  ocr_enabled: false  # disabled for privacy concerns

modes:
  patch_approval: true
  safe_editing: true
  conversational: true

identity:
  name: AIAS
  creator: Ricky
  root_path: "/home/Riekard/dev/aias_dev"

learning_rate: 0.1
max_iterations: 1000
ml_algorithms:
  - "linear_regression"
  - "decision_tree"
  - "random_forest"
  - "neural_network"

ai:
  self_awareness: true
  reasoning_model: internal_planner_v1
  memory_retention: high
  feedback_enabled: true
  interaction_mode: adaptive
```

Regarding the OCR, I've disabled it for privacy concerns. However, you can enable it if necessary while keeping in mind the potential privacy implications. The other changes made are to broaden the read-only paths and adjust the write-allowed paths according to your home directory.
